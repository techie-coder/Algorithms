## Additional Tips

- **Consistency**: Practice regularly to reinforce your understanding.
- **Concept Over Coding**: Focus on understanding the concepts before jumping to code.
- **Discuss and Learn**: Engage with peers, join study groups, and discuss problems and solutions.
- **Seek Help When Stuck**: Use online resources, forums, and mentors to get past challenging topics.
